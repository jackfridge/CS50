# My CS50 final project.
### Video demo: https://youtu.be/biHFDKGOZq0
### Web app using Flask with Python, SQL and Javascript: make-shift photography website where users can view prints.

Features included in this web app:
-Users can register
-Users must create password respecting some required guidelines, otherwise message will not allow registration
-Users must login to view images
-CSS styling is main focus to insure smooth transitions/effects and viewing pleasure
-GitHub integration within my VScode environment to start working with Git

Languages/learning done (CS50 academics):
-My main goal was to improve my CSS styling
-CSS styling for creating mobile-friendly pages
-Using a new IDE (Visual Studio Code from Microsoft)
-Getting used to Git and its functionality in VS Code

Application.py contains very similar syntax to our finance problemset in CS50. The users can register and login as we learned.
Using VS Code was different to CS50 IDE, but the syntax was similar, with a few things I had to learn how to do.
I implemented password strength caracteristics to respect.

My CSS is where I learned the most, with Javascript to animate the webpage and transitions to ensure a smooth browsing experience.
Most of the back-end python was very similar to what we learned and did not take up most of my time compared to HTML, CSS and Javscript.

I based my code on the finance problemset, where we learned how to use Flask and Jinja as a
framework with Python, SQL and Javascript.

I started to get used to Git and GitHub, and I'm still learning how to use it, but in VS Code,
extensions made it easier to integrate into my workspace. My GitHub page also hosts the source
code for my project, so I can show it or work on it anywhere I am with a computer.

I focused on CSS and Javascript, such as window scrolling effects, dynamic opacity for highlighting
images on the main browse page, and smooth transitions on buttons such as the login/register buttons
or simply hyperlinks.

In the backend, I also used styling to implement a password strength element to respect when registering.
Users have to use at least 1 upper and lowercase letter, one number, and the password must be at least
8 characters long. Any of these not respected will result in a red error message, dynamically generated
according to which caracteristic was not respected.

To further improve this website, one could implement an automatic email for confirming an email address.
On top of this, we could implement an automatic email subscription for users if there are any updates.
We could also implement a store to buy or ask for quotes that would be sent to the user's email.
Certain prints or merchandise could be implemented as an online store to purchase certain items.
