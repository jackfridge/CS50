# My CS50 final project.
### Video demo: https://youtu.be/biHFDKGOZq0
### Web app using Flask with Python, SQL and Javascript: make-shift photography website where users can view prints.

Features included in this web app:
-Users can register
-Users must create password respecting some required guidelines, otherwise message will not allow registration
-Users must login to view images
-CSS styling is main focus to insure smooth transitions/effects and viewing pleasure
-GitHub integration within my VScode environment to start working with Git

Languages/learning done (CS50 academics):
-My main goal was to improve my CSS styling
-CSS styling for creating mobile-friendly pages
-Using a new IDE (Visual Studio Code from Microsoft)
-Getting used to Git and its functionality in VS Code

Application.py contains very similar syntax to our finance problemset in CS50. The users can register and login as we learned.
Using VS Code was different to CS50 IDE, but the syntax was similar, with a few things I had to learn how to do.
I implemented password strength caracteristics to respect.

My CSS is where I learned the most, with Javascript to animate the webpage and transitions to ensure a smooth browsing experience.
Most of the back-end python was very similar to what we learned and did not take up most of my time compared to HTML, CSS and Javscript.
